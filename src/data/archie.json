So far, we have received more than 360 submissions.\n\nIf you’re comfortable, tell us about a time you cried and where it happened, be it a hidden corner in Dwinelle Hall or the middle of Memorial Glade. Also include why you were crying, whether you were happy or sad. Reviewed submissions will be added to the map.\n\nContent warning: Some of the stories below deal with themes of depression and suicide. For those seeking help, we have provided resources at the bottom of this page.\n\nBelow the map, we’ve highlighted the stories of five respondents."}]}
